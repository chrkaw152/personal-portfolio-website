            <h2>Christine Kawibowo</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Christine, a senior at Glen A. Wilson High School with a strong passion for computer science and helping others.
                With my leadership experience and active participation in various extracurriculars, I am prepared to take on challenges and offer innovative solutions.
                I am currently seeking opportunities to apply and expand my knowledge of software development and artificial intelligence in ways that can make a positive impact in people's lives.
            </p>

            <p>
                My passion for computer science started in 7th grade, when I learned Java during quarantine. Since then, I've 
                explored web development, data science, and artificial intelligence. Recently, I've grown more interested in 
                their application within the medical field.
                <br><br>
                I'm currently enrolled in the computer science pathway at Glen A. Wilson High School. In the past, I've taken
                AP Computer Science Principles, AP Computer Science A, and Cybersecurity Honors. I'm also part of the CODE, Cyber, 
                and SkillsUSA teams at my school, where I compete in competitions such as ACSL, CyberPatriot, and State Conferences.
                I was an ACSL Finalist in May of 2025, my team qualified for CyberPatriot Semifinals in December of 2024, and I placed
                third at SkillsUSA's 2025 State Conference for Computer Programming.
                <br><br>
                In the future, I hope to create something that will have a major impact on the lives of others, whether it
                be a whole community or just a single person. I also hope to graduate college with a Master's Degree and get a good job.

                I remember first typing "Hello World" and feeling like I had done something amazing. After that afternoon in the summer
                of 2020, I made several games with the basic code that I knew: MadLibs, themed math games, and more. The next thing
                I did was attend a summer coding camp hosted by the CODE Team before my freshman year, where I learned and grew to
                love web development. That whole summer, I remember making a lot of miscellaneous websites for fun, like a pretend
                boba shop website. Then came freshman year, where I had so much fun in AP Computer Science Principles. One time, for
                a mini hackathon, I completely remade the basic functions of Instagram in Code.org. Despite this taking me 
                days to complete, I never found the coding and debugging process boring. 
                <br><br>
                Even though I had already been coding for a few years at that point, I feel like I really started to improve after AP 
                Computer Science A, where I honed my critical thinking and algorithm skills. By junior year, I was finally able to
                qualify for ACSL Finals (after two years of trying), which made me feel really accomplished. Now, I'm starting to
                expand my expertise outside of just taking classes, focusing more on creating projects with real meaning that can 
                impact more people.
